# Q3-class-assignment-02

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python programs: a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and a grading system that assigns letter grades based on user-inputted scores. These mini-projects are great for practicing input handling, conditionals, and basic control flow in Python.
